<div class= "infobox">
	<p>Step away from the madness
Breathe the cold air deep in my lungs and submit to the sadness
Commit to withdraw from the battle
Gotta jump ship and hope that I land in the saddle
Hand on my heart, I wear my heart on my sleeve
But I'm never really sure of what I hope to achieve
And I never felt the cool from the rope of release
Tether to the core like dope to a fiend
So far the road's been open and free
There were a couple of tolls, I've had a couple of fees
Couple of times I've been on a couple of knees
Wishing for a couple of hours or even minutes of peace
Head spinning from the turbulent sea
Scanning the horizon for a little faith in my breed
Placing my feet among the space I'm making my sleep
Hoping the path I'm on is really destined for me </p>
